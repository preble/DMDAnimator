## DMDAnimator

An Cocoa app for editing ".dmd" files for display on dot matrix displays, particularly those used in modern pinball machines.

Aside from editing and viewing them within the app itself, a great way to use these files is with pypinproc, or pyprocgame, Python extensions for the [P-ROC](http://github.com/preble/P-ROC) project (Pinball Remote Operations Controller), which enables displaying them on an actual pinball machine in a game setting.
